In essence, a smart power meter works exactly like a traditional meter, in that 

it measures, monitors, and records your energy consumption. However, 

there’s one big difference. Rather than requiring a meter reader to check the 

usage, this electric meter relays your consumption information directly to the 

utility operator, as it’s a digital device with a communication module.
